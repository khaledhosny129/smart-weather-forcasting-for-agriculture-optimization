# Smart weather forcasting for agriculture optimization

This project utilizes the MVC architecture in Node.js with PUG as the templating engine with ai models integration to develop an intelligent weather prediction system aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity. Key features include user authentication, issue reporting, support contact, and a comprehensive user dashboard. Users can create and manage farm profiles, receive weather data predictions, and determine the suitability of their land for agriculture.




## Key Features

- User Authentication and Authorization:
    Sign up and login functionality.

- User Dashboard:
    - Create farm profiles with location and date   inputs.
    - Weather data predictions for pressure, temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
    - Farm management with view, delete, and manage options.
    - Profile management for editing name, email, photo, and password, with email confirmation alerts.
- Admin Dashboard:
    - User management with edit and delete capabilities, including pagination.
    - Farm management to oversee farm data and user associations, with pagination.







## Project Objectives:
- Utilize spectral imaging, climatic data, and agricultural data to provide accurate weather forecasts and early warnings.
- Employ AI and data analysis techniques to generate precise weather and climate predictions.
- Empower farmers with timely weather information for better crop management and strategic decision-making.
- Promote sustainable agriculture by optimizing resource use, reducing chemical pesticides, and improving productivity and quality.
