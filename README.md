Smart Weather Prediction for Agriculture Enhancement
This project is built using the MVC architecture in Node.js with PUG as the templating engine. It includes features like Login, Sign Up, user issue reporting, and support contact. The dashboard for users allows them to create a farm page where they can enter farm name, location (latitude and longitude), and date. The system then provides a prediction based on the location and date, indicating if the land is suitable for agriculture. If not, a message will be displayed indicating that the land is not suitable for agriculture.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to access the system.
User Dashboard:
Create Farm Page: Users enter the farm name, location (longitude and latitude), and date. The system predicts the suitability of the land for agriculture based on this data.
Weather Data Prediction: Provides predictions for pressure, temperature, total precipitation, and humidity. Based on these, it recommends the best crop for the location.
Farm Management: Users can view, delete, and manage their farms. They can see results and predictions for each farm.
Profile Management: Users can edit their name, email, and photo. They must confirm their email, and if not confirmed, an alert will be shown in the email input field. Users can also update their password.
Admin Dashboard:

User Management: Admins can edit and delete users with pagination for easy navigation.
Farm Management: Admins can manage farms, delete them, and view results, showing which user each farm belongs to, with pagination for better handling of data.
Project Objectives:
The project aims to use spectral imaging data, climatic data, and agricultural data to develop an intelligent weather prediction system. It employs AI and data analysis techniques to provide accurate weather forecasts and early warnings about severe weather conditions. By integrating data from weather stations, remote sensors, satellites, and on-site weather stations in farms, the system generates precise weather and climate change predictions.

The primary goal is to empower farmers with accurate and timely weather information to enhance crop management and make strategic agricultural decisions. Accurate predictions of rain, temperature, humidity, wind, and other weather factors help farmers determine optimal planting times, coordinate irrigation and fertilization, and implement pest control strategies effectively.

Furthermore, the project promotes sustainable agriculture by enabling farmers to optimize the use of natural resources and water, reduce the use of chemical pesticides, and ultimately improve productivity, quality, and reduce costs.
